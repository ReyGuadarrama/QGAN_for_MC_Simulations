This folder contains demo notebooks of this project.

1. **01-classical_simulations.ipynb**

    - This demo shows the usage of MonteCarlo class to generate classical montecarlo simulations of rolling dice, coin toss, particle decay time and two dimensional random walk.
  
2. **hybrid_qGAN**

    - **Rolling Two Dice Simulation**: This notebook demonstrates a simulation of rolling two six-sided dice using a hybrid qGAN. It includes visualizations and statistical analysis of the outcomes.

    - **10 Coin Toss Simulation**: This notebook presents a simulation of tossing a coin ten times using a hybrid qGAN. It includes visualizations and statistical analysis of the outcomes.

    - **Particle Decay Time Simulation**: This notebook simulates the decay time of particles using a hybrid qGAN. it includes visualizations followed by statistical analysis to understand the generation performance.

    - **2-Dimensional Random Walk Simulation**: This notebook demonstrates a simulation of a two-dimensional random walk using a hybrid qGAN.

3. **partial_measure_qGAN**
   
    - This folder contains the demo of the simulation of the electromagnetic calorimeter channel detector images from gluons initiated jets, using 
    an architecture which implements a non-linear transformation in the parametrized quantum circuit.

4. **quark_gluon_preprocessing**
   
    - This folder contains all the preprocessing transformations applied to the detector images from quark-gluon initiated jets, along with an analysis 
    of the changes in the total energy deposits per jet and the indiviual particle energy deposits.
